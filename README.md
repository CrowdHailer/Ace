# Ace - Educational Webserver

> Say hi, send me a message via twitter/gh-issue etc, they're all good.

[Documentation for Ace is available on hexdoc](https://hexdocs.pm/ace)

## Installation

[Available on Hex](https://hex.pm/packages/ace), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add `ace` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:ace, "~> 0.2.0"}]
    end
    ```

## Usage

Ace manages TCP connections by refering to a application level server specification.
A server must implement 4 callbacks:

- `init(connection, configuration)` for establishing a new connection.
- `handle_packet(packet, state)` to handle incomming TCP packets.
- `handle_info(message, state)` to handle application messages sent to the server.
- `terminate` to do any cleanup when the connection is closed.

#### Server

```elixir
defmodule MyServer do
  def init(_connection, state = {:greeting, greeting}) do
    {:send, greeting, state}
  end

  def handle_packet(inbound, state) do
    {:send, "ECHO: #{String.strip(inbound)}\r\n", state}
  end

  def handle_info(notification, state) do
    {:send, "#{notification}\r\n", state}
  end

  def terminate(_reason, _state) do
    IO.puts("Socket connection closed")
  end
end
```

Defining my server above we can use it to start a server managed by Ace.

#### Startup

From the console, start mix.

```shell
iex -S mix
```

In the `iex` console, start a TCP server.
```elixir
{:ok, server} = Ace.TCP.start(8080, {MyServer, {:greeting, "WELCOME"}})
```

#### Connect
Use telnet to communicate with the echo server.

```
telnet localhost 8080
```

Wihin the telnet terminal

```
# once connected
WELCOME
hi
ECHO: hi
```

In the iex session

```
send(server, {:data, "BOO!"})
```

back in telnet terminal

```
BOO!
```

## The plan

1. To take this obviously deficient TCP echo server that I wrote as a beginner elixir developer and create a fully fledged HTTP server.
2. Keep reasonable notes of progress so others can learn about how to build a web server in elixir.
3. See what progress I have made in a year as an elixir developer.

### Ace 0.1 (TCP echo)

The simplest TCP echo server that works.
Checkout the source of [version 0.1.0](https://github.com/CrowdHailer/Ace/blob/0.1.0/server.ex).
The [change log](https://github.com/CrowdHailer/Ace/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) documents all enhancements to this prototype server.


## Using Vagrant

Vagrant manages virtual machine provisioning.
Using Vagrant allows you to quickly get started with `Ace` without needing to install Elixir/erlang on you machine.

*If you do not know vagrant on you machine I would suggest just installing elixir on your host machine and ignoring the instructions here.*

```
vagrant up

vagrant ssh

cd /vagrant
```

From this directory instructions will be that same as users running Elixir on their machine.

## Contributing

Before opening a pull request, please open an issue first.

Once we've decided how to move forward with a pull request:

    $ git clone git@github.com:CrowdHailer/Ace.git
    $ cd Ace
    $ mix deps.get
    $ mix test
    $ mix dialyzer.plt
    $ mix dialyzer

Once you've made your additions, `mix test` passes and `mix dialyzer` reports no warnings, go ahead and open a PR!
