- Worker should be started with a channel? Ace.HTTP.Worker, channel unused
  # decide whether a channel should be limited from startup to single channel (stream/pipeline)
  Want to end in situation where worker can be started before connection?  

- parsing a frame returns ok even for unknown type
  parse -> categorise

- call channel -> exchange
  Add endpoint as second argument to `Worker.start_link`
  Worker knows about endpoints (that they are a process) and channels (within that endpoint)
  Start worker with endpoint before channel is estabilshed
  Maybe check when request received that channel belongs to endpoint
