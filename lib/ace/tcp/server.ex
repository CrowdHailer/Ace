defmodule Ace.TCP.Server do
  @moduledoc """
  Each `Ace.TCP.Server` manages a single TCP connection.
  They are responsible for managing communication between a TCP client and the larger application.

  The server process accepts as well as manages the connection.
  There is no separate acceptor process.
  This means that that is no need to switch the connections owning process.
  Several erlang servers do use separate acceptor pools.

  ## Example

  The TCP.Server abstracts the common code required to manage a TCP connection.
  Developers only need to their own Server module to define app specific behaviour.

  ```elixir
  defmodule CounterServer do
    def init(_, num) do
      {:nosend, num}
    end

    def handle_packet(_, last) do
      count = last + 1
      {:send, "\#{count}\r\n", count}
    end

    def handle_info(_, last) do
      {:nosend, last}
    end
  end
  ```

  # Use OTP behaviour so the server can be added to a supervision tree.
  use GenServer

  # Alias erlang libraries so the following code is more readable.

  # Interface to TCP/IP sockets.
  alias :gen_tcp, as: TCP

  # Helpers for the TCP/IP protocols.
  alias :inet, as: Inet

  @doc """
  Start a new `Ace.TCP.Server` linked to the calling process.

  A server process is started with an app to describe handling connections.
  The app is a comination of behaviour and state `app = {module, config}`

  The server process is returned immediatly.
  This is allow a supervisor to start several servers without waiting for connections.

  A provisioned server will remain in an awaiting state untill accept is called.
