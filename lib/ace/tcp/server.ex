defmodule Ace.TCP.Server do
  @moduledoc """
  Each `Ace.TCP.Server` manages a single TCP connection.
  They are responsible for managing communication between a TCP client and the larger application.

  The server process accepts as well as manages the connection.
  There is no separate acceptor process.
  This means that that is no need to switch the connections owning process.
  Several erlang servers do use separate acceptor pools.

  ## Example

  The TCP.Server abstracts the common code required to manage a TCP connection.
  Developers only need to their own Server module to define app specific behaviour.

  ```elixir
  defmodule CounterServer do
    def init(_, num) do
      {:nosend, num}
    end

    def handle_packet(_, last) do
      count = last + 1
      {:send, "\#{count}\r\n", count}
    end

    def handle_info(_, last) do
      {:nosend, last}
    end
  end
  ```

  See the README.md for a complete overview on how to make a server available.

  Invoked when a new client connects.
  `accept/2` will block until a client connects and the server has initialised

  The `state` is the second element in the `app` tuple that was used to start the endpoint.

  Returning `{:nosend, state}` will setup a new server with internal `state`.
  The state is perserved in the process loop and passed as the second option to subsequent callbacks.

  Returning `{:nosend, state, timeout}` is the same as `{:send, state}`.
  In addition `handle_info(:timeout, state)` will be called after `timeout` milliseconds, if no messages are received in that interval.

  Returning `{:send, message, state}` or `{:send, message, state, timeout}` is similar to their `:nosend` counterparts,
  except the `message` is sent as the first communication to the client.

  Returning `{:close, state}` will shutdown the server without any messages being sent or recieved
