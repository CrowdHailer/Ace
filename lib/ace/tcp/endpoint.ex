    * `:port` - the port to run the server on.
      Defaults to port 8080.

    * `:name` - name to register the spawned endpoint under.
      The supported values are the same as GenServers.

    * `:acceptors` - The number of servers simultaneously waiting for a connection.
      Defaults to 50.
